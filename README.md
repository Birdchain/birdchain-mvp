## Birdchain - New Generation Messaging App (demo)
Birdchain is a decentralized application (Dapp) similar to instant messenger. The BIG difference is that it will allow its users to make a monthly passive income, while providing companies with higher quality and better-priced services. 

This MVP simulates passive earning from selling unused SMS. Other features will be added soon: content engagement, personal data marketplace and in-app mini games.
